# E041: unclosed template

Template literals start with and end with <code>\`</code>.
It is a syntax error to omit the trailing <code>\`</code>.

    // The final ` is escaped by \.
    let temp = `c:\temp\`;

    // @@@ this barfs because the ` on this line is treated as the terminator
    // for the earlier template
    let unfinishedThought = `The solution to all of our problems is

To fix this error, ensure a backslash (`\`) is not escaping the terminating
<code>\`</code>, or include a terminating <code>\`</code>:

    let temp = `c:\\temp\\`;

    let unfinishedThought = `The solution to all of our problems is`;
