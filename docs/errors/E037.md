# E037: unclosed block comment

Block comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. It is a syntax error for a
block comment to start but not end:

    /* this code is really complicated. some might say too complicated.
       well, at least this explanation lets you know that it's complicated.
    function yes() {
      return true;
    }

    function feetToCentimeters(feet) {
        // @@@ this isn't error-highlighted because it's commented out...
        return feet /* 100;
    }

To fix this error, close the comment with `*/`.

    /* this code is really complicated. some might say too complicated.
       well, at least this explanation lets you know that it's complicated. */
    function yes() {
      return true;
    }

Alternatively, write an expression between `/` and `*`:

    function feetToCentimeters(feet) {
        return feet / 3.28 * 100;
    }
