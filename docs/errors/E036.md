# E036: stray comma in let statement

Variables declared by `const`, `let`, and `var` must be separated by a comma
(`,`). It is a syntax error to have multiple commas separating variables:

    let x = p.x,//@@@
        y = p.y - 1;

To fix this error, remove the extra commas:

    let x = p.x,
        y = p.y - 1;
